# lsqlite3complete
lsqlite3complete is a thin wrapper around the SQLite3 engine, included and statically linked (unlike lsqlite3 which links dynamically). It supports creating and manipulating SQLite3 databases, with most functions accessed through an object-oriented interface to database or SQL statement objects.
